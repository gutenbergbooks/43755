<h2><a name="Bashfulness_Diffidence" id="Bashfulness_Diffidence"><span class="smcap">Bashfulness&mdash;Diffidence.</span></a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Definition.</span></h3>

<p>We do not see why <span class="smcap">Sidney</span> should have termed
<i>diffidence</i> &ldquo;rustic shame.&rdquo; Very many nice
and proper persons who live in rural parts, and who
are exceedingly bashful, are far from being shame-faced.
&ldquo;Excessive or extreme modesty,&rdquo; Webster
defines bashfulness, and this is the better definition,
though not literally correct, as many who are rough,
impudent and vulgar in the privacy of their own
homes, are wretchedly bashful when in company of
strangers, or those whom they consider their superiors.</p>

<p>No emotion is more painful than bashfulness.
Without feeling guilty, its subject feels crushed.
Says one, &ldquo;I am troubled with a painful sense of
timidity and bashfulness in the presence of company
on being spoken to, especially at the table; and no
matter whether the person be my equal or my in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ferior,
I blush from the cravat to the hair, and the
very consciousness that I am blushing, and that my
embarrassment is discovered, tends to deepen the
blush and heighten the embarrassment. Now, I
have a good personal appearance; I have a good
education; I occupy a good position in society; I
have been trusted by my friends with official position,
and feel myself competent to fill it, and when
I sit down to meditate I feel no cause for embarrassment
or bashfulness; I can converse for hours
with persons of culture and superior ability, and
feel no cause of shame at the part I am enabled to
act; still, if then spoken to suddenly or abruptly,
this terrible diffidence comes upon me like a spell,
and makes me stammer; my head seems splitting
with excitement; my face turns red; my heart palpitates,
and I am no longer, for the moment, myself.
Now all this is very distressing.&rdquo; Yes, this
is distressing, as very many can testify from disagreeable
experience.</p>

<p>There are many influences that may directly and
indirectly be mentioned as being the</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Causes of Bashfulness</span>.</h3>

<p>Among them is a certain peculiarity of constitution
known as &ldquo;<i>natural diffidence</i>;&rdquo; then, <i>bashful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>ness
from ignorance of the ways of society; lack
of education; ill-dress; ill-health; nervousness</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Natural_Diffidence" id="Natural_Diffidence"><span class="smcap">Natural Diffidence.</span></a></h2>

<p>Many persons are constitutionally timid and diffident.
They were bashful in childhood, bashful at
school, bashful in society, always bashful. In business
they are not generally your pushing, go-ahead
operators. They shrink from contact with the bustling
crowds. They prefer, and will usually be
found doing quiet brain work in dim back offices.</p>

<p>Bashful young ladies, to the rightly constituted
masculine mind, are rather attractive than otherwise.
The timid, retiring manner; the modest,
downcast look; the soft blushes&mdash;all are particularly
engaging, especially to those who have been long
in society, and accustomed to the cool self-possession
and calm assurance of fashionable ladies.</p>

<p>The genuine diffident girl is not the product of
cities. She is not found in the crash of town life,
but in the seclusion of quiet country towns.</p>

<p>There is no class of girls in the world so easy to
get along with after they get acquainted with you,
as bashful ones. And the courting them is an easy
and delightful affair; they are so loving and confid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>ing;
no reserve, no distrust, no coquetting; but
frank, open-hearted and generous. Even if you
are unsuccessful in your suit they never mortify you
in their refusal. It is generally given in so frank
and candid a manner as to command your admiration.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i010.png" width="575" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Natural Diffidence</span> is the result, as already
stated, of certain peculiarities of constitution. There
is a want of confidence in one&rsquo;s self&mdash;a shrinking
dread of intercourse with strangers, especially those
of the opposite sex, and he, or she, can give no reason
for this diffident feeling. He may be well educated;
of attractive personal appearance, of good
conversational abilities, and well dressed, yet from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
that strange feeling of natural bashfulness, so well
known, yet difficult to describe, he is a timid, shrinking
creature, subject to trials of which a self-reliant
man has no conception. He blushes and becomes
confused if suddenly addressed. His heart beats
painfully at the idea of entering a well-lighted room
filled with ladies and gentlemen. And this feeling
is the result, in a great measure, of his small <i>self-esteem</i>.
Your truly diffident person is of extremely
sensitive, retiring disposition, and while he is apt to
accord to others superiorities they do not possess, he
entertains for his own abilities, personal and mental
qualities, the most humble opinion. And thus he
does himself great injustice and injury. He does
not attain that position in society nor that success
in professional or business life that he would were
he not shackled by his foolish timidity&mdash;his deference
to others.</p>

<p>A bold, self-confident man, with a mere fraction
of a bashful man&rsquo;s ability and attainments, will invariably
distance him in the affairs of life. &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brass</span>&rdquo;
always tells. The world don&rsquo;t stop to analyze a
man for his real merit. It takes him at his own
valuation, and if a man puts a low estimate upon
himself and goes through life with a hanging head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and blushing face, he has small success, and less
pity. The good things of this world&mdash;the successes
in love, in business, in politics, &amp;c., are invariably
won by those who have a good opinion of themselves;
who have faith in their special talents and
abilities, and who push ahead in accordance with
this faith.</p>

<p>There never was a truer saying than that faint
heart never won fair lady. While women have a
genuine admiration for the truly modest and pure-minded
men, they have a genuine contempt for your
chicken-hearted, bashful, tongue-tied fellows.</p>

<p>Although a good many screeching females in
these Women&rsquo;s Rights, Advanced Female days can
not lay special claims to any superfluous amount of
modesty, still the softer sex have not yet lost those
endearing qualities of gentleness, modesty, and loving
trustfulness in the opposite sex. Since that time
when Eve cast her first loving glances towards robust
Adam, women&rsquo;s love and admiration have gone
out to bold and gallant men. As she is timid and
weak, so the more does she admire the qualities of
strength and courage. Man is her natural protector,
and she looks up to him and clings to him in
love and confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Women are pre-eminently romantic in all that concerns
love. Her heroes are those who do brave and
perilous deeds; who scorn ease and effeminacy, and
who laugh at danger&mdash;captains who go down to
the sea in ships and sail away over the mysterious
ocean to strange, far-away lands&mdash;men who with
shut jaws, gleaming eyes, and fixed bayonets go
digging over fort walls, from which come unceasing
flashes of fire and a pitiless rain of death.</p>

<p>(How the officers and men who came home from
The War were honored, and almost caressed, especially
by the ladies; and what a host of marriages
took place among the gallant fellows!)</p>

<p>It has been truly said that no woman really loves
who has not discovered some traits in her lover&rsquo;s
character that she considers noble and heroic. It
is a glory for a woman to be able to be proud of her
lover or husband&mdash;of his superior intellect, his dignity
and strong manhood and loving care and tenderness,
and it is proverbial how a true woman
overlooks and endeavors to conceal the faults and
weaknesses of her husband. He was her hero at
marriage, and though the illusion may have passed,
she still bravely tries to maintain it.</p>

<p>It often happens that a bright, superior girl mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ries
a quiet, bashful fellow, in whom her friends do
not see anything worth marrying for. But it is certain
the girl has discovered under all the young
man&rsquo;s reserve and diffidence, superior traits of character
that have secured her attention and love.</p>

<p>This may be illustrated by an incident in which
the actors are personally known to the writer.</p>

<p>Frank W&mdash;&mdash; was a young man of more than
common intelligence and strength of character, but
he was so obstinately bashful and retiring that his
real worth was entirely unappreciated by his acquaintances.
He rarely ventured out to parties,
&amp;c., and when he did, was entirely eclipsed by all
the ready-tongued young men in the room. Now
this Frank W&mdash;&mdash; was irretrievably in love with
the most charming young lady in town, Miss Louisa
L&mdash;&mdash;, who understood and appreciated W&mdash;&mdash;,
and often gave his society marked preference, to
the surprise and disgust of the before-mentioned
ready-tongued fellows, yet was careful to give no
indication by which W&mdash;&mdash; could hope he had secured
her affections. Thus matters went on a couple
of years, and W&mdash;&mdash; was almost in despair,
though he had really made more progress than he
had imagined. But an accident occurred that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
brought matters to an agreeable termination. They
were out for a ride, with a spirited horse one autumn
afternoon, and in going down a steep hill a
rein broke, and the animal dashed forward at a tremendous
pace. W&mdash;&mdash; turned quietly towards
Miss L&mdash;&mdash;, and giving her an assuring look, placed
a foot on the dasher-board, and with a leap placed
himself fairly astride the animal. Leaning forward
and seizing the beast by the nostrils he twisted her
head suddenly to one side, and brought the whole
affair to a stand-still within half-a-dozen rods.
Soothing the excited horse by a little gentle stroking,
W&mdash;&mdash; united the rein, and then coolly drove
on as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I then and there decided to marry him,&rdquo; said
Miss L&mdash;&mdash;, relating the incident. &ldquo;I concluded
that one who could perform such a daring and dangerous
act, and regard it with quiet indifference, was
a true and noble man, and one whom I could implicitly
trust.&rdquo; And she was right, for a woman
never secured a better or more faithful husband.</p>

<p>A bashful young man who had the appearance
of no great amount of spirit, complained to his father
of his want of success in winning the esteem
of a certain proud young lady. &ldquo;You can swim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Sam?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, the next time you go
sailing with that girl, manage to dip her into the
stream, without letting her suspect you; then rescue
her like a man. Or do anything else that will
show that you have some life and pluck, and you&rsquo;ll
find she has an improved opinion of you directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the pith of wisdom is in this bit of paternal
advice.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i016.png" width="540" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NOT BASHFUL.</p>
</div>

<p>Rather than be a bashful, blushing, stuttering
booby, it would be much better for a young man to
be over-confident and bold. With the latter qualities
his chances of success in any direction in life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
would be infinitely better. And it is the stout, true
heart that finds favor with the ladies. Women
love to be sought, and have attention paid them.
It is their nature to be timid, trustful and confiding.
They love to rely upon and feel the support of manly
strength. Now a timid, bashful fellow does not
possess those qualities that women most admire,
and to possess them should be a bashful person&rsquo;s
foremost ambition.</p>

<p>The boy who hangs his head and sucks his
thumb when spoken to by a stranger, and who is
generally to be found moping behind the kitchen
fire, looking at a picture book, is not the mother&rsquo;s
favorite. The saucy little chap who sticks his fists
into his breeches pocket, and don&rsquo;t see anything in
strangers to fear; who rides the colts bare-back;
who don&rsquo;t like the girls because they can&rsquo;t climb
after bird&rsquo;s eggs; who sails about the pond on a
six foot plank; and is the leader in all kinds of
boyish mischief;&mdash;this is the brave and fearless boy
that fills his mother&rsquo;s heart with secret pride and
joy. &ldquo;The spunky little cuss,&rdquo; though coarse and
jarring, is far more pleasant to the mother&rsquo;s ear
than &ldquo;Poor child, he is so sensitive and bashful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again we repeat, women do not admire bash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ful
men. While they may pity, a woman secretly
despises a man who is really or appears to be <i>afraid
of women</i>. A diffident fellow never was nor never
will be a favorite with the ladies. It is your easy-going,
self-possessed, talking chaps who are the
popular ones. This is illustrated in any assemblage
of both sexes. Take a party, for instance, early in
the evening when matters are a little frigid. The
ladies are inclined to congregate in groups by themselves,
with shy glances towards the gentlemen,
whose inclinations seem to be that of making wall-ornaments
of themselves. Presently there will enter
the room a fellow who is not quite certain if he
understands what the word &ldquo;bashfulness&rdquo; means.
He goes up to a group of ladies, smiles and bows to
all, shakes hands with some, and is in felicity right
away, to the envy and admiration of the wall-ornament
chaps.</p>

<p>While young ladies are timid and retiring, they
dislike the exhibition of these qualities by men.
This cannot be better illustrated than by noticing
how a young man from the city, with his easy manners,
his self-assurance, and ready ways, will go into
a country village and &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; the fellows right
and left, making himself a favorite with the girls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
an amazing short time. And this fellow may be
only a shallow-brained fop from some city dry goods
store, where he is engaged measuring out ribbons
from 8 <span class="small">A. M.</span> till 6 <span class="small">P. M.</span> His education is not worth
speaking of; he smokes; he gets drunk making
New Year&rsquo;s calls; he don&rsquo;t go to church; his moral
character will not bear severe inspection, and yet
this fellow goes to the country, and even the sensible
girls rather admire him, and are well pleased to see
him coming up the walk for an evening&rsquo;s visit. The
best of the country beaux have received a good education
at the academy; they are clear in head and
sound in body, they are able to marry, owning their
own business, or soon to do so, and yet the company
of a pop-in-jay chap from the city is openly preferred
to that of these substantial and worthy country
young men. And they do not understand it, though
it is plain enough. The city fellow brings with him
an air of the great world outside this country village.
For years he has read the morning paper as regularly
as he has taken his breakfast, therefore he is
informed of all the events of the day. He can tell
you the present mental condition of Queen Victoria,
what the latest news is from Mormondom, or how
Prince Jim Jund is progressing with his railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
enterprise in Africa. He can discuss politics with
the father, talk with mother concerning the last
General Religious Convention, and with the young
ladies fairly effervesces with small talk. And here
he has at immense advantage the country young
men, whose current literature probably consists of
the Weekly County paper, fearfully dry and dull,
a city story, or Agricultural paper, and Ayre&rsquo;s last
Almanac. With these only for his mental food,
how can a young man make himself entertaining
and agreeable with chatty talk on the light topics
of the day?</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i020.png" width="530" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The city chap is brim full of pleasant gossip.
He don&rsquo;t sit cross-legged, twisting his hat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
talking tedious farm-talk to the &ldquo;old man,&rdquo; while
he is dying to be visiting with the women-folks.</p>

<p>He has long been in contact with people&mdash;the
world&mdash;and constant friction has rubbed out any
awkwardness he may have possessed years ago.
There is an agreeable ease and freedom in his manner,
as there is in that of all genuine city people,
and it could not well be otherwise. In his capacity
of salesman in a large city retail store, he has come
in contact with all classes of ladies. He don&rsquo;t blush
now when addressed by one of them. The sight
of bright eyes and pretty ankles does not throw
him into a state of flutteration, as it does our country
friend. He isn&rsquo;t afraid of the women much&mdash;not
much. He does not class them with the angel
species, to converse with whom requires great courage
and moral force. He has learned by considerable
unpleasant experience that a great many of the
gentler sex have brisk little tempers, and some
spiteful, harassing ways, and tongues that can say
sharp things:&mdash;in fact, who are very much mortal,
and so, not considering them either doves or angels,
he experiences no trepidation in their society whatever.</p>

<p>Again, our city fellow, rusticating in the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and having it very much his own way with the
damsels, is <i>well dressed</i>. His clothes are probably
not of expensive material, but they are of excellent
fit, and gives his person a stylish, genteel appearance.</p>

<p>That a person well dressed receives respect and
attention that would not possibly be shown him
were he poorly or slovenly clothed is a fact so familiar
to all that it would be absurd to discuss it.</p>

<p>The matter of Dress is of so much importance
as concerns the feeling of <i>Bashfulness</i>, that we
shall consider it fully in another chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="The_Cure_of_Natural_Bashfulness" id="The_Cure_of_Natural_Bashfulness"><span class="smcap">The Cure of Natural Bashfulness</span></a></h2>

<p>Consists:&mdash;1. <i>In cultivating</i> <span class="smcap">Self-Esteem</span>,&mdash;<i>in
exalting your own opinion of yourself</i>. <span class="smcap">Being
Proud.</span></p>

<p>2. <i>Going into company;&mdash;associating with miscellaneous
people.</i></p>

<p>1. Who ever knew a really proud person to be
bashful and diffident? What is pride? Is it not
self-esteem; self-appreciation and valuation; self-respect
and reliance; nobleness, independence and
dignity?</p>

<p>A proud-spirited person excites in us something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
that feeling of respect and admiration we have for
a spirited, mettlesome horse.</p>

<p>But to possess true spirit and personal pride, we
must possess points of real or imagined merit; of
education, accomplishments, personal beauty, or
mental, or physical superiority. How can a person
of scanty information&mdash;ignorant of the world and
its doings, carry a proud bearing with a high and
noble spirit?</p>

<p class="p2">&ldquo;How proud and stuck up them Brown girls are
since they got home from Boston,&rdquo; whispers Mrs.
Smith to a neighbor, as the &ldquo;Brown girls&rdquo; sail
into church, dressed in city style, and with something
of &ldquo;city airs.&rdquo; They have brought home
with them the same warm, generous hearts&mdash;but
they are proud. Have they not some reason for
being so? For two years they have been in
Madame C.&rsquo;s fashionable city boarding-school, and
in this time they have learned several things outside
their school books. Their rustic ways quickly
disappeared, and they soon acquired quiet dignity
of manners, and that perfect self-control we all
admire. It was taught them also that the face is
not the proper place for exhibiting our emotions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and feelings, so often to our disadvantage; and
also that the &ldquo;sweet, low voice&rdquo; that men love so
well, is much more effective than the loud, harsh
tones of so many rustic maidens.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i024.png" width="445" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They were also trained to receive introductions
from gentlemen without simpering and blushing,
and also that it was possible for a gentleman to call
upon them several times, and even invite them to a
concert, and still have no intentions of &ldquo;proposing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the Brown girls go home with their varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
accomplishments, and are &ldquo;proud.&rdquo; But it is a
personal pride to be approved of, and which all
who are bashful and backward should strive to
acquire.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="Untitled_section" id="Untitled_section"></a>Are you ambitious? Do you aspire to better
things? If you consider yourself a nobody, do you
care to be somebody? Do you care to be considered
an intelligent, interesting capable person?
Then analyze yourself; take yourself to pieces, and
see what there is really of you. We take it for
granted, of course, that you are a person of ordinary
common sense. Has your school education
been neglected? then you must rectify this by a
selected course of reading; for the first and most
important step towards removing a feeling of bashfulness
and inferiority, is to become well informed
on general topics. We maintain that it is absurd
for any intelligent person to feel awkward and
bashful who is well-informed and neatly dressed.</p>

<p>To make up for deficiencies of education, any
person determined can go through a special course
of reading in a comparatively short time, that will
make him or her a well informed person. The
books we would particularly recommend, are:&mdash;A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
concise Modern History; a small Ancient History;
Natural Philosophy (Comstock&rsquo;s High School, or
any other good, well illustrated work); Youman&rsquo;s
New Chemistry, which you will find very interesting
and highly instructive; Quackenbos&rsquo; Composition
and Rhetoric. If you read carefully Kame&rsquo;s
Elements of Criticism you would be richly repaid
in the pleasure derived, and in the gain of a rich
store of valuable information. Any person who
would be pre-eminently quick-witted must not fail
to read Shakespeare&mdash;at least the principal plays.
Shakespeare&rsquo;s knowledge of the world&mdash;of the secret
springs of human action&mdash;of <i>human nature</i>&mdash;was
something wonderful. No human being has yet
equalled him in this respect. But you cannot read
his plays as you can a newspaper. They must be
slowly read and digested like a rare dinner. The
Bible perhaps excepted, no book has yet been
printed that contains so great an amount of profound
worldly wisdom as the works of Shakespeare.
Nothing will so quickly sharpen and polish a dull
and untrained intellect.</p>

<p>Now here are enumerated less than a dozen
books, within the reach of any one capable of earning
his clothes, and which, if read at least twice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
carefully, will make a person feel that he really
knows something&mdash;had really entered the great
temple of knowledge.</p>

<p>Of course, one should not be confined to the
above. The extent of one&rsquo;s intelligence and information
will depend upon the extent of his reading
and thinking; but the above-mentioned books,
thoroughly read, will educate and elevate more
than the perusal of an entire library read hastily
and thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>The wide range of information gained by the
regular perusal of a good city daily newspaper, and
a first class monthly magazine is of too great value
to be over-estimated. If you cannot afford a daily
paper, you certainly can a semi-weekly, a large one,
like the Semi-Weekly Tribune, for instance. Of
the magazines, <i>Harper&rsquo;s</i> or <i>Scribner&rsquo;s</i> will bring
you treasures of interesting knowledge in the most
attractive form.</p>

<p>We will now suppose that you are well informed
of the news and topics of the day, etc., and that
you have no cause to feel diffident and reserved
from a general lack of information. &ldquo;But my self-esteem
is small, I have a poor opinion of myself.&rdquo;
Well, change that opinion! Be proud; resolve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
walk like a <span class="small">MAN</span> and a gentleman&mdash;not like an uncouth
boy. Hold up your head, and throw back
your shoulders. If you want a magnificent chest,
and a deep, sonorous voice; practice ten minutes,
night and morning, filling the lungs as full as possible
through a small tube, three inches long, and
with a hole the size of a quill; allow the breath to
pass out slowly through the tube. To insure an
easy and graceful carriage, practice walking in your
room with a small bag filled with grain poised on
your head. Consider yourself as good as other
people, <i>and a little better</i>. Train yourself to act
always in a quiet and dignified manner&mdash;not with
vulgar &ldquo;stiffness,&rdquo; but with that ease and moderation
of action, easily acquired, and which always
shows the well-bred person. <i>Act</i> the gentleman or
lady, and you will be one. Nothing so indicates
ill-breeding as a nervous, fidgetty, restless manner.
The real lady or gentleman will be composed
and undisturbed under every trying circumstance.
They have taught themselves <i>self-control</i>, and this
is readily learned by those with inclination and
determination to learn.</p>

<p>2. <i>Go into Society.</i>&mdash;To learn to swim you must
go into the water. To overcome the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
bashfulness, and to be at ease in company, you
must go into company. On no account should you
neglect this duty which you owe to yourself. Take
every opportunity to attend balls, picnics, parties,
sociables, etc., and always rank yourself as one of
the most desirable and popular young men of the
occasion, and you will undoubtedly be so. Remember
the fact that others will estimate you as you
estimate yourself. And here we again repeat, <i>Do
not be, or act, afraid of the girls</i>. They won&rsquo;t
hurt you. Walk boldly up and make yourself
agreeable. They will meet you half way. If at
any time you feel a little fluttering of the heart,
don&rsquo;t subside into a corner with the say-nothings
and do-nothings, but &ldquo;circulate around,&rdquo; and you
will be surprised how easily you will find yourself
at home and at ease, chatting with some nice
people.</p>

</div>

<p>For removing Bashfulness, awkwardness, and all
manner of similar disagreeable things, there could
not possibly be a better place than the dancing-school.
Young men who live away from villages,
and who have but few, or no desirable associates
outside the family circle, and who are distressingly
awkward in speech and manner, if they can have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
few terms at a dancing-school,
will be so improved in address,
manners, and general appearance
as to surprise all who know
them. We are acquainted with
a person, now an old man, large,
heavy, clumsy, who weighed one
hundred and eighty pounds the day he was sixteen,
and was six feet and an inch high. He was so
awkward, to use his own statement, that he could
hardly get into a room where there was company
without hitting both sides of the door, and could
scarcely sit down without knocking over his chair,
knowing not what to do with his feet, his hands,
nor himself. He chanced to have an opportunity
to attend a dancing-school for three months&mdash;they
were very uncommon in the locality where he resided&mdash;and
he was there trained in the common
civilities and courtesies of society; how to enter
and leave a room, how to receive introductions,
how to receive and dismiss company, etc. Though
he is a farmer, not much used to society, there is
to-day an easy, quiet grace, and a polish of manners
that would pass anywhere acceptably; and he
attributes it to the brief tuition in a dancing-school.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
While he may not remember much that he learned
as a dancer, he remembers all that he learned that
is necessary for performing the common courtesies
of the parlor. So attend all the dances possible,
and under all circumstances remember that you are
a <span class="small">MAN</span> and a <span class="small">GENTLEMAN</span>.</p>

<p>Many often hesitate and become diffident from a
lack of readiness in expressing their ideas, and from
a fear that they do not speak correctly and elegantly.
Now speaking grammatically is a mere
matter of education. If lacking in this respect, the
use of any good grammar, and particularly &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Composition
and Rhetoric</span>,&rdquo; already mentioned, with
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Live and Learn</span>;&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span class="smcap">1000 Mistakes Corrected</span>,&rdquo;
will be all you require in this direction. &ldquo;<span class="smcap">One
Thousand Mistakes Corrected</span>,&rdquo; is better than half-a-dozen
living teachers.</p>

<p>To express one&rsquo;s self with fluency in conversation
is an art that can be acquired by a little practice,
in adopting the method of the great orator Clay, in
gaining quick readiness in speech. &ldquo;I owe my
success in life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;chiefly to one circumstance&mdash;that
at the age of twenty-seven I commenced,
and continued for years the practice of
daily reading and speaking upon the contents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
some historical or scientific book. These off-hand
efforts were made sometimes in a cornfield, at others
in the forest, and not unfrequently in some distant
barn, with the horse and the ox for my auditors.
It is to this early practice of the art of all arts, that
I am indebted for my subsequent destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reading aloud from some book, enunciating every
word clearly and distinctly, with a dictionary at
hand to settle instantly in your own mind any question
as to the proper pronunciation of particular
words, is a practice so abundantly fruitful of good
results, that those who will practise it even for a
short time, will scarcely be induced to relinquish it.
In reading, cultivate the purely conversational tone.
It is as easy to read as it is to talk, yet there are
few good readers. The tone of voice, modulation,
accent, etc., should be precisely as if you were in
conversation, not as if you were preaching in a
drawling, monotonous way. Read well and you
will converse well, and both are superior accomplishments,
acquired with facility; though the orator
who pours forth his thoughts with such apparent
ease, achieves his wonderful power only by means
of patient labor, after much repetition, and, like
Disraeli, often after bitter disappointments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>So take courage, young men, and if you have a
difficulty to overcome, grapple with it at once; facility
will come with practice, and strength and
success with repeated effort. And always recollect,
that the mind and character may be trained to
almost perfect discipline, enabling it to move with a
grace, spirit and freedom almost incomprehensible
to those who have not subjected themselves to a
similar training.</p>

<p>Take a raw recruit; he stoops, he walks in a
shuffling, slouchy manner; he is painfully awkward.
A few weeks under the Drill-Sergeant, and he
walks forth erect, dignified, with the true soldierly
bearing. Life seems but for the purpose of mere
drilling. In one form or another we cannot escape
it; neither should we desire to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="Bashfulness_from_Ignorance_of_the_Ways" id="Bashfulness_from_Ignorance_of_the_Ways"><span class="smcap">Bashfulness from Ignorance of the Ways
of Society.</span></a></h2>

<p>It is certainly very embarrassing and conducive of
bashfulness to be thrust into a glittering room filled
with people superior to one&rsquo;s self in position, and
equally cultured in the knowledge of what is due
to the place and occasion. A sensitive, uncultured
man or maiden, with rustic garb and rustic speech,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and little knowledge respecting correct manners,
introduced at once to the presence of cultured ladies
and gentlemen, does not know what to do with
hands nor feet; whether to sit or to stand, or to
hide. Is it to be wondered at that such a person
acts and feels cheap and diminutive?</p>

<p>But, diffident reader, do not be discouraged, for
general good breeding is very easy of attainment.
You must possess simply <i>common sense</i>, <i>self-possession</i>,
and a <i>habit of observation</i>.</p>

<p>The exercise of a good common sense will show
you plainly enough what is right and wrong&mdash;what
is proper and improper. Self-possession will prevent
from doing awkward and bungling things;
and by observation you will soon learn the manners
of the well-bred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t know how to act, mother,&rdquo; said a
lad as he was about starting to his first party.
&ldquo;Keep your eyes open, and just do as the others
do,&rdquo; was the answer, and better advice could not
have been given.</p>

<p>Quiet self-possession will enable a person quite
unacquainted with the usages of society to conduct
himself very acceptably even in the most superior
company. It is the foolish feeling of timidity that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
causes the trepidation and bashfulness, and consequent
uneasy manners when in company, with the
class of persons for whose benefit this book was
written. <i>Why</i> should you be timid and backward,
and show by your hesitating ways that you do not
feel at ease? You surely can notice how those
about you conduct themselves, and conduct yourself
accordingly. Why should you not enter a room
filled with company like any other well-bred person,
in an easy, unconcerned manner, and addressing
those about you, even those with whom you are not
acquainted, without restraint, and without embarrassment?
If you cannot muster sufficient spirit
to do this, you had better turn travelling agent and
call from house to house till you are not afraid of
associating and conversing with strangers.</p>

<p>Yet to be well-bred without ceremony; easy
without carelessness; self-possessed and dignified
with modesty; polite without affectation; pleasing
without servility; cheerful without being noisy;
frank without indiscretion; and secret without mysteriousness;
to know the proper time and place for
whatever you say or do, and do it with the air of
the well-bred&mdash;all this requires time and close observation.
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Manners make the man</span>.&rdquo; Old, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
good. The power or influence of an easy, pleasing,
deferential manner; of a polite, gracious and genteel
address, is shown in a multitude of ways, and
is acknowledged by high and low, and could not
be better illustrated than by the success of great
Counterfeiters, Forgers, and &ldquo;Confidence men&rdquo;
generally. They are invariably men of the most
polished and insinuating address. They listen to
you with a consummate, well-bred air of interest
and attention. They flatter you unconsciously, but
none the less powerfully by the deep respect they
apparently show to every word of your conversation;
and when they address you it is as if to a
person deserving of the highest consideration.
And all this with such a combination of suavity,
self-respect and dignity that it is most powerful
to please. And these accomplished rascals have
trained themselves to polished address and perfection
of manners solely for the purpose of winning
in their schemes with men.</p>

<p>Judicious flattery is incomparable as a means of
pleasing. No person is proof against it, and one
of its most delicate and effective forms is in showing
a seeming deference to us&mdash;our conversation&mdash;opinions
and advice. The ladies are particularly sus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>ceptible
to polite and urbane manners. The act of
a gentleman raising his hat and bowing gracefully
to a lady, is really, or seemingly, a mark of esteem
and respect, and the lady is pleased, as she should
be. Little attentions thoughtfully shown are certain
to please, and to secure that regard the person
showing them is entitled to receive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a perfect gentleman,&rdquo; from a lady simply
means that he has been generous in his gallant
little attentions to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good listener,&rdquo;&mdash;and how rare they are!&mdash;can
not be otherwise than a thoughtful, sensible,
and pleasing person. By his apparent deep interest
in our conversation, he flatters our self-love;
and whoever does that, without seeming intention,
has advanced in our good opinion.</p>

<p>There is nothing so grossly rude, nor so little
forgiven, as inattention from a person whom you
are addressing. Many persons are so thoughtlessly
or ignorantly rude, that while you are speaking to
them, instead of looking at you with attention,
they will look out of the window, into the fire, or
up at the ceiling, and, it may be, speak to, or
answer some other person, thus seeming to imply
implicitly that the most trifling object deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
their attention more than anything you may be saying.
The emphatic desire in every well-ordered
mind to punish such an offensively ill-bred person
we consider highly commendable.</p>

<p>In regard to the ways and usages of society we
do not propose to say anything here, as they can be
readily learned by observation, or from any of the
several good books on the subject, mentioned in
another place.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Bashfulness_from_Ill-Dress" id="Bashfulness_from_Ill-Dress"><span class="smcap">Bashfulness from Ill-Dress.</span></a></h2>

<p>A person may have the education of a College
President, and possess the wealth of an Astor, yet
let him with soiled or slouchy clothes be suddenly
brought into the society of ladies and gentlemen,
and he will feel and act constrained and bashful in
spite of his best endeavors.</p>

<p>Let a well-bred, well-dressed person make a call
and discover, when it is too late, that his boots are
muddy, or his finger-nails not cleaned, and he will
inevitably act ill at ease, and be glad when he is
safe in the street again.</p>

<p>A mechanic going home at night in his work-day
clothes, with traces of toil on hands and face, walks
along with the well-dressed crowd in a subdued and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
humble manner. The same mechanic, two hours
later, thoroughly washed and shaved, and arrayed
in his best holiday clothes, taking his wife to a
place of amusement, perhaps, has the appearance
of another man. He walks with an erect and
manly air, and feels that he is a man among men.</p>

<p>The question of dress is one of the utmost importance.
It often determines our characters and
our success in life. A person meanly dressed will
feel meanly and act meanly. Everybody has experienced
the sudden and agreeable change in one&rsquo;s
feelings from merely changing from an old, poor
suit of clothes to a new one. The dogs, with amazing
instinct, look upon the ragged beggar with suspicion,
and meet him with growls and snaps, while
the well-dressed gentleman coming up the walk, is
welcomed with friendly wags of the tail.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Costly thy habit, as thy purse can buy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the apparel oft proclaims the man.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, from Shakespeare, is sound advice. City
people, including those who are in far more moderate
circumstances than even the small farmers, are
far better dressed than the average of country peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>ple.
The farmer&rsquo;s wife going out for an evening&rsquo;s
visit, or to church, &ldquo;fixes up,&rdquo; and makes a presentable
appearance. The farmer going to town, ten
miles away, shaves, puts on his best suit, and feels
respectable. They are going into company&mdash;going
to meet with people. On other days there seems
to be little regard for personal appearance as far as
dress is concerned. Now a resident of a city is always
in company. He is on perpetual exhibition.
He is classed as he is dressed; if like a beggar,
then a beggar; if like a gentleman&mdash;a gentleman.</p>

<p>Now, young and diffident reader, we insist that
you can never rid yourself of the bashful feeling
while in company so long as you are poorly dressed.
By &ldquo;poorly&rdquo; we do not refer to the material, only
to the style and shape. A person may wear pantaloons
and coat of the finest broadcloth, but if
they are baggy and slouchy, will he be considered
well dressed? Coarse material for coat and trousers
have been popular for several years past, and a good
suit of clothes can be bought at moderate cost. If
you live within a reasonable distance of a city, always
buy your clothes there, as you will be sure to
have them in the latest style&mdash;that is, if you notice
what the style is. Never select pantaloons with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
large checks or stripes. Light brown, or dark material
is the most becoming. If you are obliged to
have your clothes made in the country, have them
cut, if possible, by a tailor. It don&rsquo;t so much matter
who makes them up.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i041.png" width="600" height="550" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The fit of a collar adds to or mars a person&rsquo;s appearance
greatly. It should turn down and both
ends nearly meet at the buttonhole. A small brown
or black tie, with the ends tucked under the collar,
or a plain, narrow silk tie, or one of small white
and black checks, will be neat and becoming. A
large neck-tie of a flaming color, so often worn by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
country youths, is a prominent sign of an uncultivated
taste.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Hair, etc.</span>&mdash;City men, young and old, are
very particular about having their hair kept neatly
and closely cut. Why those in the country seem
to delight in shocks of long hair we never could
see; and we lived in the country twenty years.
Don&rsquo;t do it. Cultivate personal neatness insiduously,
and give an indication of it by keeping your
hair neatly trimmed. Don&rsquo;t let neighbor Smith do
it with his sheep shears, thereby saving a shilling
or two; but go to a professional barber, even if he
is in the next town.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Teeth</span> require particular attention. Use a
tooth-pick always after eating, rinsing the mouth
at the same time. Scrub the teeth thoroughly
morning and night with a tooth-brush rubbed on a
bit of soap. There is no excuse for not doing this;
a good brush will cost twenty cents, and the time
occupied about six minutes a day! The feeling of
purity and comfort experienced will amply recompense
you for the trifling trouble. Take a hot bath
as often as you can, using soap and brush freely;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and be certain that no disagreeable f&oelig;tid odor
comes from your feet from want of cleanliness.</p>

<p>That you would go into the presence of ladies
with soiled hands is not probable, but be careful to
notice that the nails are scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>These various little attentions towards personal
neatness and comeliness will soon become a second
nature. And after you have instituted these reforms
in regard to your toilet, etc., you will not
fail to observe that you are treated with a much
greater respect and consideration, especially by the
ladies, than before. Your own estimation of yourself
has greatly increased, and you find that the
miserable bashful feeling formerly experienced when
in the society of those you considered your superiors,
no longer troubles you.</p>

<p class="p2">It is important for those young men who are apt
to disparage themselves in comparison with their
wealthy acquaintances, to bear in mind that riches
and rank have no necessary connection with genuine
gentlemanly qualities. The poor man may be
a true gentleman in spirit and in daily life. He
may be honest, truthful, polite, temperate, courageous,
self-respecting, and self-helping&mdash;that is, <i>a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
gentleman</i>. The poor man with a rich spirit, is always
superior to the rich man with a mean spirit.</p>

<h2><a name="Bashfulness_Caused_by_Ill_Health" id="Bashfulness_Caused_by_Ill_Health"><span class="smcap">Bashfulness Caused by Ill Health.</span></a></h2>

<p>A person who has any noticeable physical deformity,
or who has been reduced by certain nervous
diseases, cannot be expected to possess that
buoyancy and manliness of spirit that he would
were circumstances different. Persons with nerves
that are naturally excitable, will greatly increase
their excitability by the habitual use of strong tea,
etc. As a result, they are nervous, fidgetty, and
never quite at ease. When in company they easily
lose their self-possession and do blundering things
generally. There are certain habits known to
young men that cause a person to become bashful
and sheep-faced to a surprising degree.</p>

<p>We have no particular suggestions to offer where
diffidence and bashfulness are the result of prolonged
illness or disease. Every means should be
taken to restore the health; and with the restoration
will come the old manly and courageous spirit.</p>

<p>When the nerves are weak and unsteady from
physical debility, great benefit will be immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
derived, in the majority of cases, from the use, for
two or three weeks at a time, of <i>Iodoform</i>, two or
three grains a day&mdash;taken at meal time on a bit of
moist bread.</p>

<p>In case the voice and lungs are weak, read aloud
daily, enunciating every word clearly and distinctly.
Commence by reading ten minutes at a time, and
finally half an hour. You will soon acquire a richness
and depth of tone to be proud of, besides
greatly improving your health by increasing the
capacity of the lungs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Secresy</span> is a characteristic of good breeding. A
gentleman or lady will never tell in one company
what they see or hear in another; much less divert
the present company at the expense of the last. In
conversation there is generally a tacit reliance that

<p><span class="smcap">Whispering</span> in company is an act of unmistakable

<p><span class="smcap">Incessant</span> talkers are very disagreeable companions.
Nothing can be more rude than to engross
the conversation to yourself, or to take the words,
as it were, out of another person&rsquo;s mouth. All
generally like to bear their part in a conversation,
and for one to monopolize it, is a tacit acknowledgment
that he considers his conversation of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
importance, or more interesting than that of others.
Long talkers are unmitigated bores.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giving</span> advice unasked is an impertinence. It is,
in effect, declaring ourselves wiser than those to
whom we give it; reproaching them with ignorance
and inexperience. It is a freedom that ought not
to be taken with any common acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is true politeness not to interrupt a person in
a story, whether you have heard it before or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men</span> repent speaking ten times, for once they
repent keeping silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will be reckoned by the world nearly of the
same character with those whose company you
keep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you give yourself a loose tongue in company,
you may almost depend on being pulled to pieces as
soon as your back is turned, however they may
seem entertained with your conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is ill manners to trouble people with talking
too much either of yourself or your affairs. If
you are full of yourself, consider that you, and your
affairs, are not so interesting to other people as to
you.</p>
